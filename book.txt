The last for personal enjoyment book I read was I Am Number Four which was a Sci-Fi series
where kids ran away from original planet due to other aliens attacking and landed on Earth.
Now they must hide until they are old enough to fully develop their supernatural powers and
be able to fight back. They were given a caretaker and their location must not be find out or
they will be killed. The enemy aliens are killing them in order and he's next on the list. When
he gets found out it's up to his caregiver to quickly move him to small towns around the world.
It's good. :)On branch main
